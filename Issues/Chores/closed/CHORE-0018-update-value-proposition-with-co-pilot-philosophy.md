## CHORE-0018: Update Value Proposition with Co-pilot Philosophy

## Objective
Enhance the value proposition in the READMEs to emphasize the "Co-pilot" nature of Monoco: Just-enough automation (user in control), adherence to SWE best practices (IDD, Git), and the "Process as Product" (Dogfooding) philosophy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] README_ZH.md "Core Concepts" replaced with 3 new pillars: Co-pilot, Best Practices, Dogfooding.
- [x] README.md "Core Concepts" replaced with equivalent English pillars.
- [x] The tone emphasizes "Assisted Driving" over "Full Self-Driving".

## Technical Tasks
- [x] Update `Toolkit/README_ZH.md`.
- [x] Update `Toolkit/README.md`.

## Review Comments
- Documentation now clearly positions Monoco as a tool for "Agentic Engineering" with human oversight, rather than a black-box automation tool.
- The "Dogfooding" point is critical for building trust.
