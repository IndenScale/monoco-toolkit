Hi Team,

Following up on our previous discussion about the Q1 roadmap. I've attached the updated project specification.

Key changes:
1. Moved the API integration to Sprint 3
2. Added performance optimization as a stretch goal
3. Adjusted resource allocation

Please review and let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,
Alice
