Hi Alice,

Thanks for sharing the updated specification. I've reviewed the changes:

**Approved Items:**
- API integration move to Sprint 3 ✓
- Resource reallocation looks good

**Questions:**
- For the performance optimization goal, what's the target metric?
- Should we create separate tracking issues for the stretch goals?

I'll update the internal timeline accordingly.

Best,
Prime Engineer
